  <strong>Local speech-to-text with push-to-talk typing for Linux X11 workflows.</strong>
</p>

Keystrel provides low-latency local transcription with a warm `faster-whisper` daemon, a microphone capture client, and a push-to-talk helper that types into the currently focused X11 text field.

## Highlights

- Persistent `faster-whisper` backend for low-latency reuse after warm-up.
- Push-to-talk workflow (`keystrel-ptt`) that types into focused terminal, browser, editor, and chat inputs.
- Output mute protection during capture to reduce speaker-to-mic contamination.
- Optional remote inference over Tailnet TCP while keeping local capture and typing behavior.
- Local-first tests and runtime tooling (no hosted CI required).

## Quickstart

1. Ensure the daemon is up:

```bash
systemctl --user restart keystrel-daemon
systemctl --user status keystrel-daemon
```

2. Verify microphone capture path:

```bash
keystrel-client --list-devices
keystrel-client --verbose
```

3. Use push-to-talk in any focused X11 text field:

```bash
keystrel-ptt
```

For complete setup, service operations, and remote/Tailscale flow, use the docs index below.
